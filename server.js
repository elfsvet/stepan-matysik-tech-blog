// if we change the force  from false to true it will DROP TABLE IF EXISTS This allows the table to be overwritten and re-created.
// but we don't need to drop it every time so we will change it back to false if we don't need to erase the tables

// we use the sequelize.sync() method to establish the connection to the database. The "sync" part means that this is Sequelize taking the models and connecting them to associated database tables. If it doesn't find a table, it'll create it for you!

// The other thing to notice is the use of {force: false} in the .sync() method. This doesn't have to be included, but if it were set to true, it would drop and re-create all of the database tables on startup. This is great for when we make changes to the Sequelize models, as the database would need a way to understand that something has changed. We'll have to do that a few times throughout this project, so it's best to keep the {force: false} there for now.

sequelize.sync({ force: false })
.then(() => {
    app.listen(PORT, ()=>console.log(`Now listening on port: http://localhost:${PORT}`))});
